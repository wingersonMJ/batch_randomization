# Plate Randomization for Longitudinal Data/Samples
Wingerson, MJ
## Description
This project provides a structured method and tool for randomizing participant biological samples across plates or batches while numerically evaluating the balance of key participant covariates post-randomization. The goal is to mitigate batch effects commonly encountered in the analysis of biological samples. This project, developed with support from Patrick Carry and Carson Keeter, builds upon their existing [randomization scheme](https://github.com/carryp/PS-Batch-Effect) by including a longitudinal component.
